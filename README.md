# Device Failure Analysis

## Overview 
This readme covers the summary of the analysis on the device maintenance dataset. I will show the Exploratory Data Analysis, sampling, modeling, and results. The notebook can also be referenced for further insight. 

We have the folloing problem:

A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry attributes. Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipments in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.
